# Introduction to Peripheral Interface Controllers (PIC) in C++

Peripheral Interface Controllers (PIC) are small microcontrollers commonly used in embedded systems to control various peripherals such as sensors, actuators, displays, and more. They are specifically designed to handle simple input/output (I/O) operations and communicate with other devices in the system. 

## C++ Libraries for PIC

To program a PIC in C++, there are several libraries available that provide useful functions for working with the hardware. Some of the popular C++ libraries for PIC are:

- [Microchip XC8](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-xc-compilers)
- [HI-TECH C Compiler](http://www.htsoft.com/products/compilers/picc.html)
- [CCS C Compiler](https://www.ccsinfo.com/)

## Basic Concepts

To use a PIC in a C++ project, there are a few basic concepts to understand:

### Ports

A PIC typically has several ports, each of which contains a set of pins that can be used for input or output. Ports are typically labeled with letters such as A, B, C, etc.

### Registers

Registers are special memory locations in the PIC that can be read from or written to by the programmer. They are used to control various aspects of the PIC's operation such as setting the mode of operation for a pin or configuring an interrupt.

### Interrupts

Interrupts are signals that are triggered by an external event and cause the PIC to temporarily stop executing its normal program flow and handle the interrupt event. Interrupts are useful for responding to events that need to be handled immediately, such as a sensor reading or a button press.
