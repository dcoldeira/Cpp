# Interrupts in C++

Interrupts are an important aspect of embedded systems programming as they allow for asynchronous communication and handling of events. Interrupts can be triggered by a variety of sources, such as external signals, internal timers, and other hardware events.

## Interrupt Handling

Interrupts are handled by interrupt service routines (ISRs), which are functions that are executed when an interrupt is triggered. The ISR is responsible for handling the interrupt and performing any necessary actions, such as updating a variable or communicating with other parts of the system.

When an interrupt is triggered, the processor temporarily stops executing the main program and transfers control to the ISR. Once the ISR is complete, the processor returns to executing the main program.

## Interrupt Priority

Interrupts can have different priorities, which determine the order in which they are handled. Higher-priority interrupts are handled first, while lower-priority interrupts are deferred until the higher-priority interrupts are complete.

It is important to carefully manage interrupt priorities to ensure that critical events are handled in a timely manner. In some cases, it may be necessary to temporarily disable interrupts to prevent lower-priority interrupts from interfering with the handling of a higher-priority interrupt.

## Interrupt Latency

Interrupt latency is the time between when an interrupt occurs and when the ISR begins execution. It is important to minimize interrupt latency to ensure that critical events are handled as quickly as possible.

Interrupt latency can be affected by a variety of factors, such as the processor architecture, interrupt priority, and the time required to save and restore the processor state when transferring control to the ISR.
