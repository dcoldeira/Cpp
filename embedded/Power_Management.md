# Power Management in C++

Power management is a critical aspect of embedded system design as many devices have to operate on battery power or be energy-efficient to save on electricity costs. Power management techniques are used to reduce power consumption and extend battery life without sacrificing performance.

In C++, power management can be achieved through a variety of techniques. Some of the commonly used power management techniques in C++ are:

## Sleep Modes

Sleep modes are a way to reduce power consumption in embedded systems by putting the processor into a low-power state when it is idle. The processor wakes up when an interrupt occurs or when a specific time period has elapsed. This technique is particularly useful when the processor is not required to be active all the time.

## Clock Gating

Clock gating is another power management technique that involves turning off the clock signal to certain parts of the system when they are not in use. This technique helps reduce power consumption by minimizing the number of clock cycles that are executed unnecessarily.

## Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)

Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a power management technique that adjusts the voltage and clock frequency of a processor based on the workload. DVFS helps reduce power consumption by allowing the processor to operate at a lower voltage and frequency when the workload is low and increase the voltage and frequency when the workload is high.

## Power Profiling

Power profiling is a technique used to measure the power consumption of a system under different conditions. This information can be used to optimize power management techniques and identify areas where power consumption can be reduced.
