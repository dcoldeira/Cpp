## Types of Bugs

There are several types of bugs that can occur in a program:

- **Compile-time errors** occur when the code is being compiled, and the compiler detects an error in the code. These errors prevent the program from being built.
- **Run-time errors** occur when the program is running, and something unexpected happens. These errors can cause the program to crash or behave incorrectly.
- **Logic errors** occur when the program runs without any errors or warnings, but it produces incorrect results.

## Debugging Techniques

Debugging involves identifying the source of the bug and correcting it. Here are some techniques for debugging in C++:

- **Print Statements**: Add print statements to your code to see the values of variables and control flow at different points in your program.
- **Debuggers**: Debuggers are tools that allow you to step through your program line by line and inspect the values of variables at different points in your program.
- **Core Dumps**: A core dump is a file that contains a snapshot of the program's memory at the time it crashed. You can use this file to identify the cause of the crash.
- **Memory Profiling**: Memory profiling is the process of analyzing a program's memory usage to identify memory leaks or other memory-related issues.

## Debugging Tips

Debugging easier and more effective:

- **Reproduce the Bug**: Try to reproduce the bug consistently so that you can isolate it and debug it more effectively.
- **Simplify the Code**: Remove unnecessary code and break the code down into smaller parts to help isolate the problem.
- **Check the Documentation**: Make sure you're using the correct functions and that you're passing the correct arguments.
- **Use Assertions**: Assertions are statements that check a condition and halt the program if the condition is not met. They're useful for catching errors early in the program.
