Memory management is a crucial aspect of programming, especially in embedded systems where resources are limited. In C++, the programmer is responsible for managing memory allocation and deallocation. Understanding how memory works and how to manage it efficiently is essential to avoid issues such as memory leaks and program crashes.

This guide will cover the basics of memory management in C++ for embedded systems, including:

- Stack and heap memory
- Static and dynamic memory allocation
- Memory leaks and how to prevent them

We'll also discuss best practices for memory management in embedded systems and how to use C++ features such as smart pointers to make memory management safer and more efficient.

# Stack and Heap Memory

In C++, memory can be allocated on two main areas: the stack and the heap.

## Stack Memory

Stack memory is used for local variables, function arguments, and function call frames. The stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure, meaning that the last item pushed onto the stack is the first one to be popped off.

When a function is called, its arguments and local variables are allocated on the stack. When the function returns, its call frame is removed from the stack, and the memory allocated for its variables is released. This makes stack allocation and deallocation very efficient, as it only involves moving a pointer to the top of the stack.

## Heap Memory

Heap memory, on the other hand, is used for dynamic memory allocation. Heap memory is managed manually by the programmer and is not released automatically when a function returns. This means that the programmer is responsible for deallocating heap memory when it is no longer needed.

In C++, heap memory is allocated using the `new` keyword and deallocated using the `delete` keyword. Heap memory can also be allocated using the `malloc()` function from the C standard library and deallocated using the `free()` function, but this is not recommended in C++.

Heap memory is generally slower and less efficient than stack memory, as it involves searching for a free block of memory that is large enough to hold the requested amount of data.

# Static and Dynamic Memory Allocation

In C++, memory can also be allocated statically or dynamically.

## Static Memory Allocation

Static memory allocation happens at compile time and is used for global variables and static variables. Static variables are allocated once, and their memory is reserved for the entire program's lifetime. Global variables are also allocated statically and are accessible from any function in the program.

Static memory allocation is efficient, as the memory is allocated at compile time, and there is no overhead for runtime allocation and deallocation.

## Dynamic Memory Allocation

Dynamic memory allocation happens at runtime and is used for objects that need to be created and destroyed dynamically, such as arrays and objects created with the `new` keyword. Dynamic memory allocation is less efficient than static allocation, as it involves searching for a free block of memory at runtime.

# Memory Leaks

Memory leaks occur when memory is allocated but not deallocated, resulting in a loss of available memory. This can cause the program to crash or slow down as more and more memory is consumed.

Memory leaks are particularly dangerous in embedded systems, as the available memory is often limited. To avoid memory leaks, it is essential to deallocate all heap memory when it is no longer needed. One way to do this is to use smart pointers, which automatically release memory when the object they point to is no longer needed.
